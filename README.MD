# CoroHeartToolkit
CoroHeart toolkit is a tool that allows to export assets from Compile Hearts games  made with the Orochi Engine such as Death End Re;Quest and Megadimension Neptunia VIIR

# Usage
Just double click on CoroHeartToolkitGUI to open it, navigate to your dat file and open it, you can then right click on any file to export it.

You can then look at the files on Neptools for CL3, GSTR and GBIN files or extract textures with this script I found one day that must be used with quickbms

I'm planning to implement native texture preview and exportation to the program, same for models and to reimport the changes,
but currently it only allows to export files
